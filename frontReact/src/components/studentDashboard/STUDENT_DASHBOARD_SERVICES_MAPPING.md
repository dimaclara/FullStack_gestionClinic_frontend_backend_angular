# Student Dashboard Services Mapping

This document verifies that all services used in the studentDashboard components match the API documentation and use proper service functions.

## Components and Their Service Dependencies

### StudentDashboardContent.jsx
- **Service Functions Used:**
  - [getLatestEnrollment](file:///c:\Users\etoun\Documents\pk48\inscription\soumettre\frontReact\src\services\enrollmentService.js#L12-L20) → GET `/enrollments/my-latest` ✓ (from enrollmentService.js)
  - [getAllPrograms](file:///c:\Users\etoun\Documents\pk48\inscription\soumettre\frontReact\src\services\programService.js#L9-L17) → GET `/programs` ✓ (from programService.js)
  - [submitEnrollmentForm](file:///c:\Users\etoun\Documents\pk48\inscription\soumettre\frontReact\src\services\enrollmentService.js#L42-L58) → POST `/enrollments` ✓ (from enrollmentService.js)

### Step2Documents.jsx
- **Service Functions Used:**
  - [uploadDocument](file:///c:\Users\etoun\Documents\pk48\inscription\soumettre\frontReact\src\services\documentService.js#L9-L25) → POST `/images/upload` ✓ (from documentService.js)

### EnrollmentForm.jsx
- **No direct service calls** - Acts as a coordinator component

### Step1PersonalInfo.jsx, Step3AcademicInfo.jsx, Step4ContactInfo.jsx, Step5Summary.jsx
- **No service calls** - Pure UI components that handle form data

## Service Implementation Verification

All service functions used in studentDashboard components have been verified to match the API_ENDPOINTS_DOCUMENTATION.txt:

### Enrollment Service (enrollmentService.js)
- ✅ `getLatestEnrollment` → GET `/enrollments/my-latest`
- ✅ `getMyEnrollments` → GET `/enrollments/my-enrollments`
- ✅ `submitEnrollmentForm` → POST `/enrollments`

### Program Service (programService.js)
- ✅ `getAllPrograms` → GET `/programs`
- ✅ `getProgramById` → GET `/programs/{id}`
- ✅ `getProgramByCode` → GET `/programs/code/{programCode}`

### Document Service (documentService.js)
- ✅ `uploadDocument` → POST `/images/upload`
- ✅ `getDocumentByName` → GET `/images/{fileName}`

## API Integration Compliance

All studentDashboard components now follow the service-oriented architecture pattern:
- ✅ No direct API calls in components
- ✅ All API communication handled through dedicated service functions
- ✅ Proper error handling with try/catch blocks in all service functions
- ✅ Services match documented endpoints in API_ENDPOINTS_DOCUMENTATION.txt

## Direct API Usage Check

Verification that no components use direct API calls:
- ✅ No `import api from '../../services/api'` in any studentDashboard component
- ✅ No direct `api.(get|post|put|delete|patch)` calls in any studentDashboard component

## Summary

All studentDashboard components are properly implemented with correct service usage:
1. All endpoints used match the API documentation
2. All service functions are properly implemented with error handling
3. No direct API calls are made from components
4. The form submission workflow is now properly implemented using the submitEnrollmentForm service
